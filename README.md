#### Abstract
The global trend of automation that started in 1980s in the United States has changed the occupational employment and wage structures. Previous research has shown that demand for low- and high-skilled jobs is increasing, while demand for medium-skilled jobs is shrinking, as automation replaces mid-skill routine jobs.  This dissertation aims to use a variety of data analytics methods, including exploratory data analysis and text data analytics, to gain insight into occupational employment and wage prospects and to identify drivers of occupational and wage inequality. The study finds that technology and machine related jobs frequently appeared in job compositions in the most recent decade. The text analytics result confirms that automation trends are changing employment patterns, with low-end machine and operator jobs requiring as many low-skilled people as the most skilled high-end computer and engineer jobs. Moreover, the paper concludes that manager positions are the main driver of wage inequality, and that hourly wages in manager positions may be twice as high as in other occupational categories when all observations are included in the analysis. With so many people at the lower end of the skills distribution, education is the only way to help low-skilled workers climb the job ladder.
